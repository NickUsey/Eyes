# Eye Exercise

## The object of this program is to creat an eye or eyes that are able to follow the curser around the screen, regardless of direction. You can customize this program to change the amount of eyes, change the css elements to customize the background to whatever pallet color style you desire. Have some fun with it!! For further improvements of this page, I would like to provide a spin animation to the eyes if the arrow spins around them too quickly
